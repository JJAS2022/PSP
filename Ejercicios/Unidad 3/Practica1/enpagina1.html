            <h2>Uses of Node.js</h2>
            <p>
                Node.js is a versatile technology that finds application in various development scenarios.
                Some of the prominent uses include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Development of scalable web applications.</li>
                <li>Real-time applications such as chats and real-time notifications.</li>
                <li>Development of APIs and web services.</li>
                <li>Development of streaming audio and video applications.</li>
                <li>Development of real-time and collaborative games.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Real-world examples of its application include companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal that have adopted Node.js
                to build efficient and scalable systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Use of the JavaScript Language</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript, originally a client-side language, has found a new home on the server side thanks to Node.js. Its use in both
                environments (frontend and backend) provides a more consistent development experience and facilitates collaboration
                between full-stack developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the frontend, JavaScript is essential for developing interactivity on web pages. It handles client-side logic,
                manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM), and enables the creation of dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the backend, Node.js uses JavaScript to run code on the server. This simplifies communication between the frontend
                and backend, as code and logic can be efficiently shared. The adoption of JavaScript on the server has boosted the
                popularity of Node.js and accelerated the development of full-stack JavaScript applications.
            </p>

            <h2>IDEs for Developing in Node.js</h2>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code is a highly recommended development environment for Node.js projects. It provides powerful tools,
                specific extensions for Node.js, integrated debugging, and an intuitive user interface. Its active community and
                constant improvement make Visual Studio Code a popular choice for Node.js developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Visual Studio Code is available for download at <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">visualstudio.com</a>.
